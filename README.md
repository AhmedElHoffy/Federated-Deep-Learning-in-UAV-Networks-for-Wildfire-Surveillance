# Federated-Deep-Learning-in-UAV-Networks-for-Wildfire-Surveillance
The unmanned aerial vehicle network (UAVnet) has been attracting substantial attention as a solution of 
wildfire surveillance. Application of federated learning (FL) 
for the UAV-net can provide an applaudable solution to
mitigate wildfires. Each UAV can hover at different locations
and obtain images with distinctive features. Therefore, it is 
regarded as an efficient methodology that each UAV fulfills 
different levels of deep learning (DL) in a distributed and 
collaborative fashion, which is a new paradigm raised by FL. 
This Project examines current state-of-the-art research works 
on detecting wildfire utilizing DL and UAVs. Further, this 
Project proposes utilizing FL for the UAV-net to monitor and
detect wildfire. The impact of different convolutional neural 
network (CNN) models and layers with tailored model 
parameters on the performance of prediction accuracy, is
addressed with simulations
